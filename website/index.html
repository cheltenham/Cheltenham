						<p>Four primary builders broke ground here in 1989. By 1993, a total of 157 homes on 158 lots became "Cheltenham."</p>
						<p>Located in historic <a href="http://www.centervilleohio.gov" target="_blank">Centerville, Ohio</a>, our residents have nearby access to parks, churches, and some of the best schools in the area. We are bounded to the south by Alex-Bell Road, to the east by Wilmington Pike, and to the west by the Nestle Creek sub-division and Greene Line Park.</p>
						<p>Cheltenham residents come from all walks of life, most are professionals. A few of our residents call Cheltenham their retirement home, many built or moved here because it's a great place for children and the young of heart.</p>

					(Future Dates To Be Determined)




					For more information on the book club, contact Joy Holdsworth at: AVFC@aol.com.




					We typically meet the 4th Monday evening of every month at different homes.
					We select books by suggestions offered. When the book club gets together, we usually discuss titles and reviews of books that look interesting. Then we, as a group, make some selections of what we will read. We try to plan at least two months in advance so the faster readers can read ahead, and the slower readers have time to read the books. Oftentimes our significant others call the club the wine club, but honestly we do discuss the books in detail. We read both fiction and nonfiction titles, so the club gives readers the opportunity to read genres that they normally would not read. We usually average about 10 to 12 people at the meetings, but there is always room for more book lovers.

					Contractors Mentioned by our Neighbors

					Here is a list of contractors recommended by individual homeowners.

					Bathroom Remodeling (See General Contracting)

					Bugs:

					Bugs or Us, Ken Packard                       254-000

					You’re close to the “bug belt” here.  We’ve experienced mainly water bugs, but this guy can help with anything from ants to termites.  It’s about $40 per visit for quarterly service.  We do monthly because we don’t like bugs.

					Cabinet Makers (also see General Contracting):

					Josh Cohen                                          789-8694      cohen03@juno.com

					Outstanding wood worker and cabinet maker who works for John Abrecht Fine Homes but is now taking other carpentry jobs as well.  Two Cheltenham homeowners think he's great!!

					Carpet / Flooring:

					Innovative Floors                                   848-7200

					Carpet Cleaning:

					Perfection Carpet Cleaning                    299-1256 or 235-1150

					Ask for Bob and say Melissa Lush recommended you.  This company is great. They get our older, and very light carpet, looking great time after time with $$ that is always competitive.

					Johnny's Carpets                                 426-6130

					Kirk's Carpet Cleaning                          426-5772

					Drywall Repair:

					Magic Drywall, Jon                               270-7324

					Excellent quality and service.  We had major drywall damage from a roof leak.  Their ceiling repairs were PERFECT.  We also had them do some wall and ceiling work in the basement.  Amazingly quick and cheap.  They also have a painter on staff who does amazing touch-ups quickly and cheaply.

					Duct Cleaning:

					Sears Duct Cleaning                             http://searsclean.com/airduct.asp


					Southtown Heating & Cooling                298-4200

					McAfee                                                ?
					Electrician and lighting:

					Reliable Electric                                   433-7595

					Good with the basic stuff.  Reasonable knowledge of lighting, but not lighting consultants.

					Becker Electric                                     226-1341

					http://www.ohiolampandfixture.com/

					General Contracting:

					Remodeling Designs                             438-0031  www.remodelingdesigns.com

					I've heard many good things about Remodeling Designs.

					They are extremely honest, trustworthy, and reliable.  Highly respected by local building associations.

					Tend to be REALLY expensive -- sometimes two times or more what you would expect to pay!

					Kistler & Son                                        298-0906   http://www.adkistler.com/

					They specialize in bathrooms, but they can do any contracting work.  They did two of our bathrooms, a double sliding glass door in the living room, and are now working on a few other projects.  Archie is the father.  Kevin is the son.  Both used to work with Remodeling Designs.

					Rich Rose                                            673-2860

					Professional, dependable, and detail-oriented.  His prices are reasonable for the quality he provides.  He has replaced most of the windows in our house and repaired all of the cedar (2283 Wahsum Circle).  He does a lot of work for the Primrose School of Centerville on Alex-Bell.

					Bob Armstrong                                    620-7757

					I would like to recommend Bob Armstrong for home remodeling and repair work to you.  He had a business doing custom millwork and cabinets and has worked in the building trades for 30 years.  He is a dealer for high-end cabinetry.  He lives in Centerville and is very pleasant and presentable.  He is very professional and neat.  His business has been affected by the economic downturn in construction.  He has done tile work in  our kitchen which turned out great.  He is currently re-grouting and re-caulking bathrooms for us.  If you are considering any bathroom or kitchen remodeling, I would highly recommend him.  He is also available for almost any type of home repair.  If he encounters a job he does not feel comfortable doing, he knows a lot of people in the trades and could recommend someone else.


					Gutter Repairs and Leaf Guard Gutter System:

					J Squared Construction        Jon           270-7324

					Most reasonable rates in town.  And excellent quality.
					They also do other types of work (e.g., experts at drywall and repairs).
					They installed larger gutters for us and also the Alcoa Leaf Guard System.  Absolutely wonderful!!!

					Handymen:

					Handyman Matters                               435-7003

					OK but much too expensive for what they provide.

					Heating and Air Conditioning:

					H&M Heating & Cooling Inc.                  296-0454

					We reached a point where it was time to replace both furnaces and both air conditioning units.  Our go-to guy, Rod Borkenhagen, was tied up with a big job.  He recommended Mike Morgan of H&M.  Wow, we couldn't believe service could be this good.  Everything from beginning to end was absolute perfection.  They even had recommendations for fixing other non-HVAC problems we had.  I've lived in 24 houses with more than my share of HVAC problems.  These guys are the best!  And they're just down the road on David Road in Kettering.

					Rod Borkenhagen                                830-5877

					A one man show, but extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  Makes his money on commercial work, so reasonable residential rates.  Excellent work!!!!

					Southtown Heating & Cooling                298-4200

					I (Karen Posey) would highly recommend Southtown Heating and Cooling.  They are very good and they guarantee their work.  My brother and sister-in-law own the business.  If you mention either my name or that you live in Cheltenham, they will give you a discount.  Joe and Terry Trame are the owners.
					We also replaced AC and heat with Southown and they have been wonderful!


					We are very happy!  Wish I knew about the discount then!

					McAfee                                               ?

					We have used McAfee in the past and they have been very good to work with.


					Brockman and Sons                            222-8638

					We replaced both AC and furnace and have been very happy with them.  We put in a Lennox high efficiency unit.



					Interior design:

					Caston's Designs                                   ?

					Landscaping:

					Siebenthaler, Janice Mittelkamp            274-1158

					Lots of 1-2 man operations...most we wouldn’t invite back.  This year we switched to a big outfit, Siebenthaler, for our mulching, bed maintenance, planting of annuals, perennials, shrubs, fertilizing, trimming, etc.  They're great.  Not cheap, but really great.

					Buckeye Landscaping                            885-4048

					Buckeye Landscaping is offering Cheltenham residents a discounted price on topsoil and mulch.  If two yards or more are purchased, they will not charge a a delivery fee.  The Black Gold mulch and their processed top soil are $30 a yard.

					Lawn service:

					Poor Boy Lawn Service, Brian Shriver     256-5474

					We (and about 6 neighbors right next to us) use Poor Boy.  Average of $30 per week for mowing, trimming, edging, blowing.  Also does mulching, spring and fall cleanup, etc.

					Tom Martin                                          224-0215
					(Jablinksi, Folino, Roberts & Martin)


					Painting:

					Fred Goddard Painting                          478-4407 cell phone

					Really good and amazingly cheap, also will do wallpaper, decks, doors, fences, etc..  Does very thorough prep work and caulking on exterior before painting.  The only negative is he and his crew are difficult to schedule because he is so popular.  He’s not in the book.  All his business is repeat clients and referrals.

					Bill Sandlin                                           270-2062, 253-7622


					Scot Gillam                                          475-9122

					We have used him extensively and he always has the best prices and does the best job of any painter we’ve ever had.  He is neat, thorough, conscientious, and speedy.  He also did a great job of caulking our cedar siding before painting and did a wonderful job just a week ago.

					Remodeling (See General Contracting)

					Roofing Installation and Repair:

					Castle Roofing                                      236-7405

					Castle Roofing put the roof on our home just before we moved in 7 years ago.  They     did a wonderful job.

					I agree.  Castle Roofing did our roof too.  It looks beautiful and it was a decent price.

					Copeland Roofing                                 426-2956

					Copeland roofed my previous house as well as my current house.  They did a tremendous job.  I'm very satisfied with the work.

					Pelfrey's Roofing and Gutters                429-5169

					Pelfrey did our roof in 2004...very good and very reasonable.  We will call them again for more work this summer.

					Williams Brothers Roofing                      233-4175

					Not the cheapest, but extremely experienced.  They’ve been in Dayton a long time.  Also EXCELLENT repair work!

					Snow Plowing:

					The bug guy, Ken Packard                     254-0002

					Our standing order is when the snow is more than 2-3 inches.  That's only two or three times per winter here in this "southern" climate.  He does the driveway and our front walk to the front door.  Reasonable rates.

					Tree Service:

					Scott Bradstreet                                   748-8840

					Scott has taken out 20 or so trees in our yard and the neighbor's yard, as well as stumps and trimming.  He also has a bucket truck to get all those large branches overhanging the house.  Bonded, insured, quality oriented.


					Jim Britt                                               (513) 897-8585

					Reliable, bonded and all that.  Probably not the cheapest.

					Window Cleaning:

					Sonrise Window Cleaning                      436-4499

					We have used them twice and find their rates to be quite good and they do a great job.  They also have a water pole (like they use in the UK) to clean the roof of our solarium.  It is less expensive this way and there is no need for a person to be on the roof to clean it using this technique.  As far as we know, they are the only company in Dayton to use this money saving technique.

					Arrow Window Cleaning, Mike Pierce.      859-8210


					Incredibly cheap and good.  Well mannered; not afraid to have him in our home.  We have a LOT of windows.  He does all of them, inside and out, for about $200.  We’ve used him for years.  Again, not in the book, just repeat business and referrals.

					Bowties                                              436-3005
