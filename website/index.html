						<p>Four primary builders broke ground here in 1989. By 1993, a total of 157 homes on 158 lots became "Cheltenham."</p>
						<p>Located in historic <a href="http://www.centervilleohio.gov" target="_blank">Centerville, Ohio</a>, our residents have nearby access to parks, churches, and some of the best schools in the area. We are bounded to the south by Alex-Bell Road, to the east by Wilmington Pike, and to the west by the Nestle Creek sub-division and Greene Line Park.</p>
						<p>Cheltenham residents come from all walks of life, most are professionals. A few of our residents call Cheltenham their retirement home, many built or moved here because it's a great place for children and the young of heart.</p>

					Interested in a Men's Dining Club?

					Dayton has some great restaurants, both new and old.  If you would be interested in getting together once a month (or once a quarter), contact Kirk Tyson at kirk.tyson@cheltenham.cc.


					Interested in Playing Bridge?

					We have about 10 women in our bridge group and would love to have more.  We play in the evenings, starting at about 7pm. Many are beginners, so no one should feel shy about coming.

					We'd also like to get a daytime group started if we could get enough interested players. We play once per month, rotating hostesses.  The hostess chooses the day. We usually drink wine and have a good time -- no serious playing.

					If you're interested in playing bridge with us, call Mary Rose at 439-2672 or send an email to mrcomeo@yahoo.com

					(Future Dates To Be Determined)




					For more information on the book club, contact Joy Holdsworth at: AVFC@aol.com.




					We typically meet the 4th Monday evening of every month at different homes.
					We select books by suggestions offered. When the book club gets together, we usually discuss titles and reviews of books that look interesting. Then we, as a group, make some selections of what we will read. We try to plan at least two months in advance so the faster readers can read ahead, and the slower readers have time to read the books. Oftentimes our significant others call the club the wine club, but honestly we do discuss the books in detail. We read both fiction and nonfiction titles, so the club gives readers the opportunity to read genres that they normally would not read. We usually average about 10 to 12 people at the meetings, but there is always room for more book lovers.

								<td>Bob Armstrong</td>

								<td>I would like to recommend Bob Armstrong for home remodeling and repair work to you.  He had a business doing custom millwork and cabinets and has worked in the building trades for 30 years.  He is a dealer for high-end cabinetry.  He lives in Centerville and is very pleasant and presentable.  He is very professional and neat.  His business has been affected by the economic downturn in construction.  He has done tile work in  our kitchen which turned out great.  He is currently re-grouting and re-caulking bathrooms for us.  If you are considering any bathroom or kitchen remodeling, I would highly recommend him.  He is also available for almost any type of home repair.  If he encounters a job he does not feel comfortable doing, he knows a lot of people in the trades and could recommend someone else.</td>
