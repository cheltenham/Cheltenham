		<p>Four primary builders broke ground here in 1989. By 1993, a total of 157 homes on 158 lots became "Cheltenham."</p>
		<p>Located in historic <a href="http://www.centervilleohio.gov" target="_blank">Centerville, Ohio</a>, our residents have nearby access to parks, churches, and some of the best schools in the area. We are bounded to the south by Alex-Bell Road, to the east by Wilmington Pike, and to the west by the Nestle Creek sub-division and Greene Line Park.</p>
		<p>Cheltenham residents come from all walks of life, most are professionals. A few of our residents call Cheltenham their retirement home, many built or moved here because it's a great place for children and the young of heart.</p>
