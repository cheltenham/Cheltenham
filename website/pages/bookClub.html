<h2>Claudia's Book Club</h2>

<p>We typically meet the 4th Monday evening of every month at different homes.</p>
<p>We select books by suggestions offered. When the book club gets together, we usually discuss titles and reviews of books that look interesting. Then we, as a group, make some selections of what we will read. We try to plan at least two months in advance so the faster readers can read ahead, and the slower readers have time to read the books. Oftentimes our significant others call the club the wine club, but honestly we do discuss the books in detail. We read both fiction and nonfiction titles, so the club gives readers the opportunity to read genres that they normally would not read. We usually average about 10 to 12 people at the meetings, but there is always room for more book lovers.</p>
<p>For more information on the book club, contact Joy Holdsworth at <a href="mailto:AVFC@aol.com" target="_blank">AVFC@aol.com</a>.</p>
