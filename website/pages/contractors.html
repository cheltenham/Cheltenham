He is a dealer for high-end cabinetry.  He lives in Centerville and is very pleasant and presentable.  He is very professional and neat.  His business has been affected by the economic downturn in construction.  He has done tile work in  our kitchen which turned out great.  He is currently re-grouting and re-caulking bathrooms for us.  If you are considering any bathroom or kitchen remodeling, I would highly recommend him.  He is also available for almost any type of home repair.  If he encounters a job he does not feel comfortable doing, he knows a lot of people in the trades and could recommend someone else.</td>
